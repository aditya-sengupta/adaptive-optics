    "## Dynamic systems\n",
    "\n",
    "A dynamic system is, roughly speaking, any system that evolves in time. This evolution in time is based on its initial state, the system input, and some underlying equations. The classic example of a dynamic system is a cart on rails, whose initial state is known to be an $x$ position and $x$ velocity of zero, and that moves based on an applied force, which is the system input. Once a force is applied, the cart starts to move according to Newton's laws:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\begin{eqnarray*}\n",
    "x = x_0 + v_0 t + \\frac{f}{2m} t^2\\\\\n",
    "v = v_0 + \\frac{f}{m}t \\end{eqnarray*}$\n",
    "\n",
    "These are the state-transition rules of the cart.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can make predictions about the state of a dynamic system based on its state-transition rules and knowing some initial state. However, when these dynamic systems are implemented in practice, the state transitions do not perfectly match the predictions. The predictions do not account for environmental disturbances, which cannot be accurately estimated upfront. In the case of the cart, there may be a friction force preventing the cart from moving perfectly according to its state-transition rules. Therefore there is some uncertainty surrounding the prediction as to how close it is to the actual state.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of a Kalman filter is to combine the predicted system state (including uncertainty) with measurements of the system that are noisy and therefore have their own uncertainty, in order to get a better estimate of the system state over time. \n",
    "\n",
    "A succinct way to describe what a Kalman filter does is that it combines *physics* and *reality*: we build a physical model to obtain some expectation of what a system should do at any given time, and we combine that with what we know is really happening \n",
    "\n",
    "## State-space representation of dynamic systems\n",
    "\n",
    "Dynamic systems can be represented in *state space* by defining a *state vector* of the form $\\vec{x} = [\\begin{matrix} x_1 & x_2 & \\dots & x_n \\end{matrix}]^T$ that contains variables describing the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "A dynamic system can be described based on the time-evolution of the system state as well as how the system output $\\vec{y}$ relates to the control input $\\vec{u}$ and state. This is done in continuous time by specifying a set of first-order differential equations and combining them into one equation using matrices,\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\begin{eqnarray*}\n",
    "    \\vec{\\dot{x}}(t) = A'\\vec{x}(t) + B'\\vec{u}(t)\\\\\n",
    "    \\vec{y}(t) = C'\\vec{x}(t) + D'\\vec{u}(t)\n",
    "\\end{eqnarray*}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, the matrix $A'$ is referred to as the *state-transition matrix* and the first equation is the *state-transition equation*. To verbally describe the other matrices, you could call $B'$ the *state-transition input gain*, $C'$ the *state-to-output matrix* and $D'$ the *input-to-output gain*, but only $A$ has a generally accepted verbal description.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dynamic systems can have many possible equivalent state-space representations depending on the choices of state variables, but for real-life systems that are easily described by a finite number of parameters, it is easiest to describe the system in that representation. For linear systems, it is possible to translate a state-space representation to a *transfer function* representation and from there transform it into an alternative state-space representation that is more useful for controller or observer design (described [here](https://www.engr.mun.ca/~millan/Eng6825/canonicals.pdf)). For Kalman filtering it isn't necessary to do this, but it may make it easier to reason about systems by changing the representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In discrete time, the setup is similar to continuous time, but with a *difference equation*,\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\begin{align}\n",
    "    \\vec{x}((k+1) \\Delta t) & =  A\\vec{x}(k \\Delta t) + B\\vec{u}(k \\Delta t)\\\\\n",

    "The general control problem is to design a control system to regulate the behaviour of any dynamic system, usually through a feedback loop. Control usually requires access to the full state, which is not always available; all that is guaranteed is access to the system output. Therefore, a system called an *observer* is used to obtain the state from the output, and from there a controller acts to provide the optimal system input such that the system operates as desired. This is usually quantified by certain performance metrics like overshoot from a desired state, error in the steady state (as time goes to infinity), the rise time (delay between a control input and the corresponding desired output), and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "An $n$-dimensional system is called *observable* if $n$ measurements of the output $y$ are sufficient to uniquely determine $x[0]$, the initial system state.

It can be proven that the Kalman filter is the optimal linear observer, in the sense that its state estimates have the minimum mean-squared error (MMSE). \n",
    "\n",
    "Let a system (called the *plant*, i.e. the system to be controlled) have dynamics $\\hat{\\dot{x}} = A'\\hat{x} + B'u$ and $\\hat{y} = C'\\hat{x}$, and let there be a measurement $y$ of the system. The error between the estimated and actual measurements is then $y - \\hat{y} = y - C'\\hat{x}$. We can update the state equations of the plant to construct those of the observer, by applying a proportional gain to this error and adding this scaled error in to the state-transition equation:\n",

Simple linear systems can do this in the Laplace domain by designing $K$ such that the transfer representation has a certain desired transfer function, simply by matching terms and solving a linear system based on that. The Kalman filter approach works entirely in state-space; instead of a desired transfer function, it builds an error gain matrix (often called the *Kalman gain*) based on the physical model and the uncertainties in both the physics and measurements.\n",

    "## The rocket dynamic model\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll demonstrate Kalman filtering on data collected from a rocket launch. The rocket is called Sub-Arktos. It was made by the UC Berkeley high-powered rocketry team, CalSTAR, as a subscale launch vehicle for the NASA Student Launch competition in 2017.\n",
    "\n",
    "High-powered rockets usually fly using commercial off-the-shelf motors, which provide on the order of 10 Gs in thrust over a very short time. Once a rocket reaches apogee (the highest point of flight), it deploys parachutes so that it comes down gradually rather than at its terminal velocity, so that it can be recovered without damage. The condition for parachute deployment is usually reaching apogee, a specific time delay after apogee, or reaching a specific altitude during descent. Sub-Arktos flew with two parachutes, which is reasonably standard for an apogee on the order of a mile. The first was a small \"drogue\" chute deployed at apogee, so as to make the rocket fall gradually, but still fast enough that it does not drift too much during descent. The second was a larger \"main\" chute deployed at an altitude of 800 feet, to ensure the rocket is falling slowly enough that impact is soft and there is no damage to the airframe.\n",
    "\n",
    "To deploy parachutes at the correct time, it is necessary to have a good idea of the rocket's state at any given time. However, knowing the rocket's state is dependent on altimeter and accelerometer data, which may be noisy. But since we know from simulation approximately what the rocket state at any given time should be, determining when the rocket is likely to be at apogee or at some specific altitude during descent is a perfect Kalman filtering problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're interested in how the rocket simulation was developed, I'd love to discuss it in detail in person or in a different notebook; for here I'll just use it to demonstrate filtering without explaining much of what's under the hood. Essentially, it's just solving for the rocket's position, velocity, and acceleration based on those values at the previous timestep and the force on the rocket over time. Accurately modelling the force was the difficult part; after that, it's essentially just like the example above.\n",
    "\n",
    "The state-transition equations can be discretized according to the formulas given previously to get\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\begin{bmatrix} x(t + dt) \\\\ \\dot{x}(t + dt) \\\\ \\ddot{x}(t + dt) \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & dt & \\frac{dt^2}{2} \\\\ 0 & 1 & \\frac{dt}{2} \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} x(t) \\\\ \\dot{x}(t) \\\\ \\ddot{x}(t) \\end{bmatrix} + \\begin{bmatrix}0 \\\\ \\frac{dt}{2m(t)} \\\\ \\frac{1}{m(t)} \\end{bmatrix} f(t)$\n",
    "\n",
    "Ordinarily, the 2D state $\\begin{bmatrix} x(t) & \\dot{x}(t) \\end{bmatrix}^T$ would suffice, but I included acceleration in the state because one of the sensors is an accelerometer, and for Kalman filtering to work, the measurements have to depend only on the state.\n",
    "\n",
    "It should also be noted that this is an approximation, using second-order (velocity verlet) integration instead of something like a fourth-order Runge-Kutta method. You could do that in the form $x(t + dt) = Ax(t) + Bu(t)$ as well, but $A$ and $B$ would vary with time (more accurately, they would vary with the state) which makes it computationally difficult to filter in real time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that there's a slight oversimplification that both my simulation and the reference simulation make, to do with main parachute deployment. Both model it as an instantaneous process, with the chute providing zero drag until it's time for it to be deployed and its full drag thereafter. This essentially creates a Dirac delta-type spike in the acceleration that's slightly offset between the reference and reality, and likely isn't what you'd see on a real-life accelerometer. Therefore, for this example, we're going to assume that Sub-Arktos only has a drogue chute and no main  chute. This reflects what actually happened to the rocket at its last launch, so it seems reasonable to simulate. If you want to see a simulation with the main parachute included, take a look at 'subarktos/subarktos.py' under this repo."
